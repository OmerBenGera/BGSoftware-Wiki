# Java-15
If you want to use Java 15 and you want to use SuperiorSkyblock as well, you must download an external scripts engine.<br>
The script engine is used for various of things in the plugin, including calculation of levels, for missions and more.<br>

### How to install an external scripts engine?
There are multiple different script engines available, but this tutorial will be focused on Nashron Engine.<br>
This is the default and most common engine to use. You may find a link to its github [here](https://github.com/BG-Software-LLC/SuperiorSkyblock2-NashornEngine/).<br>
You may find more information about the other scripts under the [addons page](superiorskyblock/addons/?id=custom-script-engines-addons).

!> Note: If you choose to use GraalVM Engine, make sure you have GraalVM set up correctly!

##### First Step: Download the engine jar
Open the link of your chosen engine, and click on the "Releases" tab, as shown below:

Once you opened the link, you'll find a download link to the jar under the "Assets" tab:

<br>

##### Second Step: Add the engine to your modules folder.
After you downloaded the jar, you need to move it to the modules folder.<br>
This process is similar to the process of installing a regular plugin! Simply take the jar and drag it to your modules folder under SuperiorSkyblock's folder.<br>

##### Last Step: Start your server!
This is the last step - simply start your server again! The plugin will load the module and set up everything for you!<br>
