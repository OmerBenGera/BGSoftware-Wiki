### Create your own permission
In order to create your own permission, you must have knowledge in Java and the Spigot API.<br>
Alongside of these, you'll also need the SuperiorSkyblock's API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/OmerBenGera/SuperiorSkyblockAPI).<br><br>
Island permissions are represented as a class called "IslandPrivilege", and it's really easy to register custom ones!<br>
In this tutorial, I will make a custom permission for breaking beacons inside islands. First, I register the custom permission<br>
by listening to the PluginInitializeEvent, and there I am calling the IslandPrivilege.register() method.<br>
```java
public final class BeaconPlacePermission implements Listener {

    private static IslandPrivilege BEACON_BREAK;

    @EventHandler
    public void onPluginInit(PluginInitializeEvent e){
        IslandPrivilege.register("BEACON_BREAK");
        BEACON_BREAK = IslandPrivilege.getByName("BEACON_BREAK");
    }

}
```

!> PluginInitializeEvent is called in the onEnable() method of SuperiorSkyblock. Therefore, you must have your plugin enabling<br>
before SuperiorSkyblock, which can be done by adding "SuperiorSkyblock2" as a depend/softdepend plugin.<br>

After registering the custom permission, we can simply implement the restirction for breaking beacons!<br>
```java
public final class BeaconPlacePermission implements Listener {

    private static IslandPrivilege BEACON_BREAK;

    @EventHandler
    public void onPluginInit(PluginInitializeEvent e){
        IslandPrivilege.register("BEACON_BREAK");
        BEACON_BREAK = IslandPrivilege.getByName("BEACON_BREAK");
    }
    
    @EventHandler
    public void onBlockBreak(BlockBreakEvent e){
        //Checking for beacons only.
        if(e.getBlock().getType() != Material.BEACON)
            return;

        Island island = SuperiorSkyblockAPI.getIslandAt(e.getBlock().getLocation());
        
        // Making sure the block was broken inside an island.
        if(island == null)
            return;
        
        if(!island.hasPermission(e.getPlayer(), BEACON_BREAK)){
            e.setCancelled(true);
            e.getPlayer().sendMessage("" + ChatColor.RED + ChatColor.BOLD + "Error | " + ChatColor.GRAY + "This island is protected.");
        }
    }

}
```
That's it! Now players must have the BEACON_BREAK permission in order to mine beacons.<br>
You can simply add the new permission to the permissions menu, and edit it's display icon there, the same as the regular permissions.<br>
