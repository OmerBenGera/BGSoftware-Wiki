# Menus
Menus (guis) are used in the plugin in many cases, and they are all fully customizable.<br>
In this documantation, you will understand how to edit them to your own style!<br>
Menus also support placeholders!<br>

### Editing your first menu
<div class="offset-para">All the menus follow the same concept, but some of them have some changes.<br>
Here we will go through all the basic sections, that every menu has / can have.<br><br>
<u>title</u>: The title of the menu.<br>
<u>type</u>: The type of the menu. Can be HOPPER or CHEST.<br>
<u>pattern</u>: The pattern of the menu. This section is basically the layout of the menu.<br>
Every line represents a line in the menu, and every char represents an item (besides spaces).<br>
<u>items</u>: A section that contains all the chars from the pattern. Every char should have a child-section under this section,<br>
with the item that you want to have in the place where the char is. If the char doesn't have a child-section, the slot will be empty.<br>
<u>sounds</u>: A section that holds all sounds for all the chars. This section is not required and can be deleted if wanted.<br>
Every char you want to play sounds, needs to be under this section, and must follow the sounds format (type section (String), volume section (Double) and pitch section (Double)).<br>
<u>commands</u>: A section that holds all the commands for all the chars. This section is not required and can be deleted if wanted.<br>
Every char you want to run commands, needs to be under this section, and be a list of commands (without slash).<br>
If you want the command to be executed by the player, add "PLAYER:" at the start of the line.
